# Experius Product website ids module for Magento 2
Adds functionality to the API configure which websites Magento auto-assigns new products to when website_ids are not defined in API-call

This configuration can be found under Services - Magento Web API

### This module uses a preference for the productRepository class which could conflict. Unfortunately there was no other way.
